NAME
    Data::FormValidator::Filters::Image - Filter that allows you to shrink
    incoming image uploads using Data::FormValidator

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::FormValidator::Filters::Image qw( image_filter );

        # Build a Data::FormValidator Profile:
        my $my_profile = {
            required => qw( uploaded_image ),
            field_filters => {
                uploaded_image => image_filter(max_width => 800, max_height => 600),
            },
        };

        # Be sure to use a CGI.pm object as the form input
        # when using this filter
        my $q = new CGI;
        my $dfv = Data::FormValidator->check($q,$my_profile);

DESCRIPTION
    Many users when uploading image files never bother to shrink them down
    to a reasonable size. Instead of declining the upload because it is too
    large, this module will shrink the image down to a reasonable size
    during the form validation stage.

    The filter will try to fail gracefully by leaving the upload as is if
    the image resize operation fails.

FILTERS
  image_filter( max_width => $width, max_height => $height )
    This will create a filter that will reduce the size of an image that is
    being uploaded so that it is bounded by the width and height provided.
    The image will be scaled in a way that will not distort or stretch the
    image.

     example:

     - upload an image that is 800 x 600
     - specify a max width of 100 and max height of 100

     The resulting image will be 100 x 75, since that is the
     largest scaled image we can create that is still within
     the bounds we specified.
